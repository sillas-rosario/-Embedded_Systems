 ###  
 This code was made intending to Read - Filtering- Write Binary File. 
 I broke down the code into a some .c file to make it easy to understand.
 I put the wav song for download, check the wav_songs Folder attach to Embedded System
 
 
 # First Step #
 
 Read  the wav file header and handle with the bitwise (Endnesses)
 
 ## Second Step ##
 
 I have implemented the filter in matlab and saved as .txt file 
 
 ### Thrid Sted ### 
 
 Once I have read the wav header and the data  I implemented a convollution function 
 to filtering the data 
 
 #### fourth step ####
 
 I write the header and the new- filtered-data back into a wave_soung.out
